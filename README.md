HOW TO USE
----------

   Import
   ------
   
    You can import existing (eclipse/dart) xml theme files
     
    -click "chose file"
    -select file
    -click ok 

   Export
   ------
   
    You can export the dart theme xml
    
    -enter author (not needed)
    -enter theme Name (required)
    -click "export"

   Interconnection
   ---------------
   
    The code and the theme attributes are linked
    
    if you click on an element inside the code, 
    it highlights the according attribute options

    while hovering over the attribute options,
    all connected code elements will ba surrounded by a red box 

   Toogle unused options
   ---------------------
   
    Toggle attributes that I found from xml files 
    but whre I could not think of good code samples   
   
    If you can think of code samples for unused attributes 
    I would be happy to add them
   
   Wired keywords in dart and eclipse??
   ------------------------------------
   
    Some keywords like setter and getter are not used by Dart Editor,
    even though these types do exist.
    
    I dont like the linking between html tags and dart variables
   
    if anyone knows who to talk to about that, let me please know.
